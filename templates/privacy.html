    <p>
      ATC Resume Builder ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your
      privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and
      safeguard your information when you visit our website.
    </p>

    <h3>1. DATA COLLECTION & USAGE</h3>
    <p>
      <strong
        >We are designed to be privacy-first. We do NOT store your personal
        resume data on our servers.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Session Data:</strong> When you use the Resume Builder, the
        information you enter (name, email, skills, etc.) is stored temporarily
        in your browser's session. This data is required to generate your resume
        preview and PDF. This session is automatically deleted when you close
        your browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uploaded Resumes:</strong> When you use the Resume Analyzer or
        other AI tools, your uploaded PDF is processed on our server to extract
        the text. This text is sent to the Google Gemini API for analysis and
        then immediately discarded from our system. The file itself is not
        stored after processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Newsletter:</strong> If you choose to subscribe to our
        newsletter, we collect your email address. This is strictly optional and
        requires your explicit consent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES (GOOGLE GEMINI API)</h3>
    <p>
      To provide our AI features, we send the text content from your resume (or
      summary prompts) to the Google Gemini API. We do not send any personally
      identifiable file names. Google's use of this data is governed by their
      own
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
        >Privacy Policy</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>3. COOKIES</h3>
    <p>
      We use a necessary cookie for security purposes (CSRF token) to protect
      our forms. We do not use tracking or advertising cookies.
    </p>

    <h3>4. YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR)</h3>
    <p>
      As we do not store your personal data, the rights of access,
      rectification, and erasure are fulfilled by our system's design. You have
      full control over the data you input, and it is removed when your session
      ends.
    </p>

    <h3>5. SECURITY</h3>
    <p>
      We implement security measures like CSRF protection and best practices to
      protect the data during its brief processing period. All communication
      with our server is encrypted via HTTPS.
    </p>
